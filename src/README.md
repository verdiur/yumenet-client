# Implementation details

The `src/` directory is organized in this way :

- `utils/` contains utilities;
- `comp/` contains all components;
- `sys/` contains all systems;
- `core/` contains the actual game logic.

`main.cpp` is compiled into an executable at compile time.

<!-- # Styling

- Maximum line length is 100 characters, without counting EOLs.
- Use 2 EOLs between each class/function block.
- Pointers are written like so: `type *p_name`. References are styled the same.
- Include guards are made with `#pragma once`.
- All files must contain a GPLv3 mention.
- Consult this for more info: [https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines] -->
